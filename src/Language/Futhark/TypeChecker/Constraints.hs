-- | A shape component is currently just unit. The rank of an array is
-- then just the number of shape components it contains in its shape
-- list. When we add AUTOMAP, these components will also allow shape
-- variables. The list of components should then be understood as
-- concatenation of shapes (meaning you can't just take the length to
-- determine the rank of the array).
